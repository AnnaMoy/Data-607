The New York Times web site provides a rich set of APIs, as described here: (https://developer.nytimes.com/apis)

Youâ€™ll need to start by signing up for an API key.

Your task is to choose one of the New York Times APIs, construct an interface in R to read in the JSON data, and transform it into an R DataFrame.

# Load library
```{r library, message = FALSE}
library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
```

# Load API and API Key on the URL and load as dataframe
```{r API}
books_url <- ("https://api.nytimes.com/svc/books/v3/lists/names.json?api-key=lB6izVNFT7zMy5s1eRiPKwEAfBlAyctS")

books <- GET(books_url)

books2 <- fromJSON(content(books, type = "text"))

books_dataframe <- as.data.frame(books2)
books_dataframe
```
